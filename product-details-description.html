          Beryl Cook is one of Britain’s most talented and amusing 
          artists .Beryl’s pictures feature women of all shapes and 
          sizes enjoying themselves .Born between the two world

          or grown children leaving for college are all reasons that someone accustomed to 
          cooking for more than one would suddenly need to learn how to adjust all the
